## Orchard is a command line tool to manage projects with HappyFunJuice.

It integrates with

* HappyFunJuice
* github
* heroku
* hipchat
* lighthouse

# Installation

    gem 'orchard'

# CLI Usage

    orchard help
    orchard projects
    orchard project info Juice
    orchard project addmember Juice will@happyfuncorp.com

# Using orchard in other scripts

Orchard::Client is the main entry point.  This will return a configured client, for example one of:

    Orchard::Client::JuiceClient
    Orchard::Client::HipchatClient
    Orchard::Client::GithubClient

If you haven't logged in to juice, it will ask you, and then it will pull the auth code for the given project.  Sometimes it will return a organization API code since they work off of projects.  The hipchat is stored on the Organization level for example.

    require 'orchard'
    juice = Orchard::Client.juice_client
    juice.profile

or

    require 'orchard'
    Orchard::Client::hipchat_client.post_message room_name, message

## Details

This tool will be installed on developers and managers machine to facilitate the creation and management of third party services, and make it possible to wire them together.

# HappyFunJuice

The tool will require a juice account to use, and will piggy back on the authentication used in juice.  If itâ€™s more expedient to call juice, rather than local gem call, do so.
